## Properties

### Android Version
![](/assets/images/components/utilities/device-tools/p_android-version.png)

\[ Getter only | Blocks only \]  
`Type: Text`

The Android Version of the device, in the format `x`.`y`.`z`. (For example, the Version of Android Oreo is 8.1.0)


### API Version
![](/assets/images/components/utilities/device-tools/p_api-version.png)

\[ Getter only | Blocks only \]  
`Type: Text`

The Android API Version of the device. The API Version is an integer value that uniquely identifies the framework API revision offered by a version of the Android platform.
The Android platform provides a framework API that applications can use to interact with the underlying Android system.

!!! info
    More information about Android Versions and API Versions can be found in the [Android Source API List](https://source.android.com/setup/start/build-numbers).


### Board
![](/assets/images/components/utilities/device-tools/p_board.png)

\[ Getter only | Blocks only \]  
`Type: Text`

The device board represents the physical layer of plastic on the device (i.e. the industrial design of the device).
For example, North American devices probably include QWERTY keyboards, whereas devices sold in France probably include AZERTY keyboards. 
This layer also represents the bare schematics of a product. These include the peripherals on the board and their configuration. The names used are merely codes for different board/device configurations. `goldfish`, `sardine`, and `trout` are a few examples.



### Bootloader Version
![](/assets/images/components/utilities/device-tools/p_bootloader-version.png)

\[ Getter only | Blocks only \]  
`Type: Text`

The Version of the device's Bootloader.

!!! info
    The Bootloader is the code that runs on a device before the operating system starts up. 
    This low-level code contains the instructions that tell a device how to start up and find the system kernel. 
    The bootloader usually lives on the system board in non-volatile memory and is often specific to the device.
    

### Brand
![](/assets/images/components/utilities/device-tools/p_brand.png)

\[ Getter only | Blocks only \]  
`Type: Text`

The brand name of the device's OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer).
    

### Build Number
![](/assets/images/components/utilities/device-tools/p_build-number.png)

\[ Getter only | Blocks only \]  
`Type: Text`

The build number of the Android Version of the device. Build numbers are alphanumeric strings that can uniquely identify each release of Android. `PQ3B.190705.003` and `FRF85B` are some examples of Android build numbers.

!!! info
    More information about build numbers can be found in the [Android Source Build Numbers List](https://source.android.com/setup/start/build-numbers#source-code-tags-and-builds).
    

### Country Code
![](/assets/images/components/utilities/device-tools/p_country-code.png)

\[ Getter only | Blocks only \]  
`Type: Text`

An ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code or UN M.49 numeric-3 area code representing the country/area the device is currently in. `US` (United States), `FR` (France), and `029` (Caribbean) are a few examples.

    A list of all country codes can be found [here](https://countrycode.org/).
    

### Device Id
![](/assets/images/components/utilities/device-tools/p_device-id.png)

\[ Getter only | Blocks only \]  
`Type: Text`

An alphanumeric string that can uniquely identify an Android device.

!!! info
    When a device has multiple users (available on certain devices running Android 4.2 or higher), each user appears as a completely separate device, so the **Device Id** value is unique to each user.
    
!!! caution
    Certain OEMs are known to have botched the **Device Id** implementation. For example, all Motorola Droid2 devices return the same **Device Id**. Use caution before relying on this property to uniquely identify users and/or devices.
